##  1. Problem Statement:
> While s/w upgrade to FRR docker or while maintenence FRR docker restart, minimum disturbance to Control Plane Route (i.e Kernel Route) should happen. For some organisation, it is critical to keep control plane unreachability less than ~1 secs for critical services to work with switch while FRR docker restart.
Today Zebra can run with -r flag to retain routes in kernel. But during startup:
i.) Without -k flag: Zebra cleans all kernel routes and insert them back if learned via BGPD/OSPF or any other protocol again. This may take 10-15 secs. [Data copied below.]
> ii.) With -k flags: Zebra rib contains stale routes, which will not be deleted ever. Also depending on preference calculated by zebra, these stale route result in no update to kernel and FPM.

## 2. Observation:
> Below analysis were done before deciding on the approaches, which can be used to solve above problem.

### 2.1  Zebra restart with -k -r options.
Before restart:
```
B>* 100.1.0.32/32 [20/0] via 10.0.0.63, Ethernet124, 00:01:46
B>* 172.16.16.0/32 [20/0] via 10.0.0.63, Ethernet124, 00:01:46
B>* 172.16.16.1/32 [20/0] via 10.0.0.63, Ethernet124, 00:01:46
B>* 172.16.16.2/32 [20/0] via 10.0.0.63, Ethernet124, 00:01:46
B>* 172.16.16.3/32 [20/0] via 10.0.0.63, Ethernet124, 00:01:46
B>* 172.16.16.4/32 [20/0] via 10.0.0.63, Ethernet124, 00:01:46
C>* 172.25.11.0/24 is directly connected, eth0
```
After restart:
Zebra has 2 routes per destination. [Behavior may have changed on later Zebra, i.e >=6.0.2]
```

C>* 172.25.11.0/24 is directly connected, eth0
```
Ip monitor: Zebra adds no new route, because it already preferred kernel routes.

----
### 2.2 Kernel static route with same prefix and same NHs.

[Note: Kernel Static route analysis was done in more detail, but is not included in this Design Doc. Because kenrel static routes are not used in detail in SONiC.]

FRR Restart when kernel has extra route same prefix and same NHs but lower matrix than zebra: [Same behavior is observed for high matrix, Zebra always prefere Kernel Route.]

Add Kernel Static route
```
sudo ip route del 172.16.16.2/32 via 10.0.0.63 metric 15
```
Kernel:
```
172.16.16.0     10.0.0.63       255.255.255.255 UGH   20     0        0 Ethernet124

```
Frr before restart:
```
B>* 100.1.0.32/32 [20/0] via 10.0.0.63, Ethernet124, 00:01:46
B>* 172.16.16.0/32 [20/0] via 10.0.0.63, Ethernet124, 00:01:46

C>* 172.25.11.0/24 is directly connected, eth0
```
Ip monitor:
```
sudo ip route add 172.16.16.2/32 via 10.0.0.63
172.16.16.2 via 10.0.0.63 dev Ethernet124
Deleted 172.16.16.2 via 10.0.0.63 dev Ethernet124  proto zebra  metric 20
```
As per IP monitor, Zebra,  after listening about kernel static routes, deletes BGP route from kernel and FPM. For FPM, a code was added to keep protocol inforamtion in APP_DB, which confirm same behavior.

APP_DB before Kernel Static Route:
```
127.0.0.1:6379> HGETALL "ROUTE_TABLE:172.16.16.2"
1) "nexthop"
2) "10.0.0.63"
3) "ifname"
4) "Ethernet124"
5) "protocol"
6) "ZEBRA"
```
After adding kernel Static Routes:
```
127.0.0.1:6379> HGETALL "ROUTE_TABLE:172.16.16.4"
1) "nexthop"
2) "10.0.0.63"
3) "ifname"
4) "Ethernet124"
5) "protocol"
6) "KERNEL"
```
After restart routes remains same as above in kernel and FPM, because no updates was sent from Zebra.

Zebra Route:
[Zebra does not learn about ARP, In Sonic NeighSyncd listens to netlink and populates APP_DB. So Sonic and Linux kernel both keep route table and Neighbour table seperately. Which suggests if a zebra route has same prefix as ARP\NDP Entry then Conflict happens only in H/W, and it depends on H/W which one will be preferered.]

Restart ZEbra\FRR will have no impact on Neigh_Table.

### 2.6 Kernel keeps only one copy of Routes from one source.
This is important because if zebra sends multiple adds to kernel for same route via netlink, where rtm_protocol field is same as before then kernel will only update this entry, but will not add a new entry.
To check this, multiple add\update were sent to kernel from zebra.

## 3. Proposed Solution and comparison:


| Field | FPMSYNCD | ORCHAGENT | ZEBRA RIB |
| ------ | ------ |------ | ------ |
| Description   | Utilize current approach of DB reconciliation in FPMSyncd. Once reconciliation is done, send the netlink to kernel with add/del/change to APP_DB. | Utilize current approach of DB reconciliation in FPMSyncd. Inside Orchagent, When RouteOrch class processes these APP_DB route entries to update ASIC_DB, same time send the netlink to kernel. | Read kernel Routes while Zebra starts up, and change Zebra RIB calculation to reconcile with old kernel route. After reconciliation , Send an update to kernel and FPM about new route. Also delete stale kernel routes from rib after reconciliation. FpmSyncd DB reconcilation code may go away.  |
|Special handling while System Restart (warm reboot). |     Since Kernel route will be deleted due to restart, FPMSyncd needs to populate kernel routes while restoration process. While restoration FPMSyncd Reads APP_DB Routes in a MAP. |   This approach needs no special handling for this case, since after coming up Orchagent will recompile APP_DB route entries to create new ASIC_DB. Kernel routes will be installed during this compilation. |    During startup Zebra has to read routes from APP_DB for restoration. Which means Many APIs must be exposed to Zebra. This may not be needed, if current APP_DB reconciliation remains in FPMsyncd. But it is good to deprecate FpmSyncd DB reconcilation, with that, kernel route should be populated similar to neigh table from APP_DB after restart. |
| SWSS docker restart | No special case handling. | Orchagent will recompile APP_DB route entries to create new ASIC_DB. Orchagent will send another netlink to kernel.  If no change (or just add\change) in DB, Kernel routes will remain same. Because kernel keeps only one route per prefix from Zebra. If route del in APP_DB was done during swss restart. Orchagent will send netlink del msg to kernel, because events are queued in DB. | No special case handling. |
| OwnerShip |   FPMSyncd will be clear owner of route both in Kernel and DB. May rename as RouteMgrD.|  Source of truth will be APP_DB for kernel Routes. FPMSyncd will add APP_DB route and Orchagent will add kernel Route.    | Similar as today. Zebra will be Routing Manager and owner.|

With this approach serialization mechanism will be needed in Orchagent.   | Separate handing per Family is not needed, as of now, Zebra does not support MPLS. |

| When static (or kernel learned) Route is Added before FRR restart. [See Observations section for complete data.]  | When Static Route is added, Zebra learns about it and sends a delete to kernel and FPM. So kernel and FPM keep only one copy of route for this prefix.  After Zebra Restart:  [ADD= Zebra learns same route, Change = Zebra learns same prefix with NH change, DEL = Zebra does not learn same prefix.]  # Case ADD: After restart Zebra will learn kernel static route from kernel while start up. And Zebra will learn same prefix Route via BGP. Zebra will choose kernel route in RIB calculation. Zebra will send no update to APP_DB and kernel. [**This case shows rtm_protocol = RTPROT_ZEBRA in netlink message is necessary, else Zebra would not have considered Static Route in RIB Calculation.] As per current code, it will delete APP_DB Route. [APP_DB reconciliation will not delete Route if rtm_protocol is stored in DB.] # Case Change: Same as ADD. # Case Del: Same as ADD, except Zebra will not learn any BGP Route for same prefix. | Same | Rib Calculation will not change for Static or kernel learned route. It will work fine without FpmSyncd DB reconciliation code. |
| When static (or kernel learned) Route is Added during FRR restart. i.e. Zebra was down when kernel route was added.   | This is hard to recover scenario. Since Zebra is down while static route is added to kernel. No delete message is received by kernel and FPM. As a result kernel has 2 routes for same prefix and APP_DB has zebra route [non static route] in DB. | Same | Same |
| ARP/NDP is learned which has same prefix as zebra route. | After learning, Kernel will add ARP in neigh table which will have pointer from route table, but will not have an entry in route table. So Zebra and FPM will play no role in it because they never know about the ARP entry. From neighsyncd, ARP entry will be installed in APP_DB, then ASIC_DB and then in H/W. So H/W will learn about same prefix as neighbor and as Route. H/W behavior is out of scope because it may vary.
| **Brief Implementation details.** |
| Zebra code changes: | Zebra uses kernel_route_rib() to add/del/change in kernel route. kernel_route_rib() calls netlink_route_multipath(). In netlink_route_multipath(), update must be blocked for single\multi path route to kernel. Propagate EOR down to FPMSyncd after sending routes update to FPMSyncd. Note: Zebra will be started with -r option (Retain kernel Route option) but without -k option. So After restart Zebra will try to delete all Zebra routes from kernel, but due to block in netlink_route_multipath(), no change will go to kernel. This Delete will go to FPM for previous Zebra Routes, but this is fine because FPMSyncd keeps only one entry for each destprefix. So at last the final update will come into effect. | Same as Fpmsyncd | During startup in netlink_route_change_read_unicast(), all stale zebra routes learned from kernel will be marked with a special flag. If a route is learned for same prefix then stale route will be marked for deletion while adding new route in rib_add_multipath(). For remaining stale routes, a sweep function will be called with EOR or with timer. An option will be introduced in Zebra to enable kernel reconcile functionality. |
| FPMSyncd Code changes | RouteTableWarmStartHelper will be inherited from WarmStartHelper class, which will override  WarmStartHelper::reconcile() to send netlink message to kernel while updating DB. FpmSyncd needs to handle EOR message and call reconciliation when arrive. To handle warm reboot case. Similar handler must be called from runRestoration(). Netlink message creation part should be implemented for each family. | FpmSyncd needs to handle EOR message and call reconciliation when arrive. | FpmSyncd DB reconciliation may be deprecated. |
| Orchagent Code Changes |  N/A | In RouteOrch Class functions, whenever SaiRedis API call is done to update ASIC_DB, a call to netlink_kernel_route() must be done to sent netlink msg to kernel. Netlink message creation part should be implemented for each family. | N/A |

## 4. Approach Selected

Approch 3 : To change Zebra RIB Calculation is chossen to address FRR-Kernel Reconciliation after condereding all above comparision points.

## 5. Low Level details:

### 5.1 Before Fix:

![](https://github.com/praveen-li/docs/blob/master/Before%20frr_kernel%20fix.png)

Above image explains the Zebra behavior right now on startup with -k (keep_kernel_mode option.
```
1.) Zebra reads kernel routes including previous instance of Zebra routes.

2.) Zebra pushes these routes in RIB Table as per family of route.

3.) Rnode creation and route_entry creation of old kernel route is done and route_entry is inserted in Rnode of the destprefix. Next-hops for this route will be markes as active, since this route is learned from Kernel. Note: This will result in call to rib_process, but since Rnode contains only one route which is already in FIB, so rib_process will result in NO_OP.

4.) Bgpd will queue new routes to Zebra after getting first keepalive (implicit EOR) from bgp peer.

5.) Zebra will process new routes and call rib_add() for this route.

6.) A new route_entry will be created and will be inserted in correct Rnode. There may be 2 scenarios here, a.) Rnode already contains other routes including old kernel routes or new Rnode is created for this route_entry.

7.) Updated Rnode will be queued for rib processing. During rib processing, Zebra will run best route selection, which on most of the FRR version will select old kernel route which is already marked as active in FIB.

8.) No update will be sent to Kernel and FPM, which may result in route deletion from APP_DB as per current Fpmsyncd DB reconciliation code. Update will be sent only for those route for which stale kernel route is not present.
```

Current behavior will result in:
```

1.) Route deletion from APP_DB.

2.) Stale route in Kernel.

3.) Stale routes in Zebra RIB.
```

### 5.2 After Fix:

![](https://github.com/praveen-li/docs/blob/master/After%20frr_kernel%20fix.png)

```
1.) Zebra reads kernel routes including previous instance of Zebra routes and mark them with ZEBRA_FLAG_KERNEL_STALE_RT.
A timer will start (default 60 secs) to clean stale kernel routes.

2.) Zebra pushes these routes in RIB Table as per family of route.

3.) Rnode creation and route_entry creation of old kernel route is done and route_entry is inserted in Rnode of the destprefix. Next-hops for this route will be markes as active, since this route is learned from Kernel. Note: This will result in call to rib_process, but since Rnode contains only one route which is already in FIB, so rib_process will result in NO_OP.

4.) Bgpd will queue new routes to Zebra after getting first keepalive (implicit EOR) from bgp peer.

5.) Zebra will process new routes and call rib_add() for this route.

6.) A new route_entry will be created and will be inserted in correct Rnode. There may be 2 scenarios here, a.) Rnode already contains other routes including old kernel routes or new Rnode is created for this route_entry. In first case, if previously exist route is marked with ZEBRA_FLAG_KERNEL_STALE_RT, then previous route will be marked for deletion.

7.) Updated Rnode will be queued for rib processing. During rib processing, Zebra will run best route selection, which will select newly learned route since stale kernel route is marked for deletion.

8.) Update will be sent to Kernel and FPM in all cases.

9.) Upon timer expire, a sweep function will mark all reamining routes with ZEBRA_FLAG_KERNEL_STALE_RT flag for deletion. Eventually rib_process function will free stale route.

10.) This will result in delete update to kernel and FPM.
```

After fix, it will result in:
```
1.) Kernel and FPM getting updated only when (and as soon as) new route is learned.

2.) Stale routes in Kernel and fpm will be cleaned after timeout.

3.) No Stale routes in Zebra RIB.
```

## 6. Code Details:
-   new option to zebra: 

A new option -K <secs> is added to zebra. -K is choosed to match with -k (small -k) because both deals with stale kernel routes.

Use Case:
zebra -K 30
(Option -K is for kernel level graceful restart. 30 is timer after which all stale kernel routes will be cleaned. With in 30 mins all newly learned kernel routes will be gracefully updated.)

2.) Zebra pushes these routes in RIB Table as per family of route.

3.) Rnode creation and route_entry creation of old kernel route is done and route_entry is inserted in Rnode of the destprefix.

10.) This will result in delete update to kernel and FPM.


## 7. Unit Test Plan:

Unit Test Plan includes below 3 test cases: [All 3 test cases will be repeated for IPV4 and IPV6 family]

### 7.1 Summary UTP

Test Case 1.) Ping\Fast Ping 3 destinations using PTF from the source address which used BGP Routes. Ping will run continuosly during FRR restart.
    -  Create Ping packet in PTF.
    -  Create Expected Packet.
    -  Sent Ping packet on port 1.
    -  Verify expected Packet on Port 2.

Test Case 2.) Test add, change and delete in BGP prefixes across FRR restart.

    - Have 2 BGP peers publishing 5 prefixes each, where 2 prefixes are published from both peers.
    - Observe expected routes in Zebra and Kernel.
    - Stop FRR
    - Add a new prefix to publish in peer1.
    - Add a prefix to publish in peer1 which was published only from peer 2 before.
    - Delete a prefix from peer2 which was published from both peer1 and peer2.
    - Delete a prefix from peer2 which was published only from peer 2 before.
    - Start FRR.
    - Observe Zebra logs, ip monitor, kernel routes and Zebra routes.

3.) Scaled testing: Perform FRR restart with  > 6 K routes published from at least 4 peers. [6500 routes with 32 peers, as per T1 topology], [6k routes and 4 BGP peers as per T0]

    - Have atleast >3 BGP peers publishing same 6k prefixes. Rest BGP peers can publish 10-15 routes each which are unique.
    - Observe expected routes in Zebra and Kernel.
    - Stop FRR
    - Bring 1 BGP peer down which publishes 6k routes. [Change case ECMP to Non ECMP].
    - Change all published prefixes from 1 BGP peer which publishes 10-15 routes.  [ADD and DELETE case]
    - Start FRR.
    - Observe Zebra logs, ip monitor, kernel routes and Zebra routes.

### 7.2 Detailed UTP:

#### Test Case 1.) Ping\Fast Ping 3 destinations using PTF from the source address which used BGP Routes in DUT. Ping will run continuosly during FRR restart.

   **Verify expected Packet on Port 2.**

For Example: If installed BGP routes are as below:
```

B>* 192.168.0.9/32 [20/0] via 10.0.0.1, Ethernet0, 00:00:29
```

**Create Ping packet in PTF.**

PTF ICMP packet will be:
```
pkt = simple_icmp_packet(pktlen=pktlen,
    eth_dst=self.router_mac,
    eth_src=src_mac,
    ip_src="192.168.0.6",
    ip_dst="10.0.0.0",
    ip_ttl=64)

Packet:
00:e0:ec:7b:ba:bb > 52:54:00:4b:bb:87, ethertype 802.1Q (0x8100), length 102: vlan 1681, p 0, ethertype IPv4, 192.168.0.6 > 10.0.0.0: ICMP echo request, id 19456, seq 9, length 64
```

**Create Expected Packet.**
```
exp_pkt = simple_icmp_packet(pktlen=pktlen,
                eth_src=self.router_mac,
                ip_dst=ip_src,
                icmp_type=0)
```

**Sent Ping packet on port 1.**
```
send_packet(self, src_port, pkt)
```

**Then Verify the Packet on Port 2:**
```
(matched_index, received) = verify_packet_any_port(self, masked_exp_pkt, [2]])
```

####  Test Case 2.) Test add, change and delete in BGP prefixes across FRR restart.

- Have 2 BGP peers publishing 5 prefixes each, where 2 prefixes are published from both peers.

Routes are published to DUT from 2 BGP peers: (Track 192.168.0.* routes)

## 11.  Memory consumption

    Zebra will consume memory similar to -k option till timer with -K expires.

##   12. Performance
```
    Zebra already perform sweep and entire rib list look up. So performance will not change.
```
